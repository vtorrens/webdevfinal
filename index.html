                    <ul>
                        <li>During 2020/21 many families in Jordan have had to face the reality of a lost school year due to the Covid pandemic. </li> 
                        <li>Parents and children have been spending most of their time at home in front of screens.</li> 
                        <li>In July 2020, a group of parents in Amman created a whatssapp chat to share fun (non-electronic! and social) family oriented activities and classes.</li>
                        <li>Soon it became a success, and the effort was expanded to create an interactive quarterly newsletter with expanded information for the community.</li>

                <h3>September 2021 Newsletter</h3>
                
                <p>Dear Family Fun Jordan Community,</p>
    
                    <p>This summer has been a relief for many of us. With a significant improvement of the epidemiological situation in the Kingdom, we have been allowed to enjoy more and more activities outdoors and indoors! Some of us were lucky enough to be able to travel to international destinations. But for the ones that stayed, Amman has been buzzing with all sorts of family oriented activities for all ages. </p>
                    
                    <p> In this issue, we cover  <a href="./featured.html">many new possible exciting ventures</a> that you should check out, but we are also starting a new section of the newsletter: <a href="./interview.html">Quarterly Interview</a>. But many of you had requested for a more "personal" descriptions of the experiences so we decided to take it really deep featuring an in-depth interview to a family in the community. We will be sitting down and talking with a different family every quarter. This quarter we had the pleasure of interviewing the Pizarro Torrens family. They arrived from Panama in 2020 in the middle of the pandemic but we can already consider them "experts" in doing fun things with their spair time in Jordan. We interviewed parents and children! (spoil alert: their opinions differ widely).</p>        
                    <p>If you would like your family to be interviewed in one of our future issues, please get in touch via our <a href="#">Contact Form</a> or drop us a line in <a href="#">Whatsapp</a> or <a href="#">Email</a>. 
                    
                    <p> We hope you enjoy this edition of the newsletter and that it will encourage you to go out and check out everything that the Kingdom has to offer to families like yours. </p>    
                    
                    <p> With love,</p>
