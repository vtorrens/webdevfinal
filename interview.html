                <h2>The Pizarro's Favorite Activities "In Their Own Words" </h2>  
                    <p>For this issue of our magazine we had the pleasure of sitting down with the Pizarro family. They arrived from Panama to Jordan in August of 2020 in the middle of the pandemic. But the covid restrictions and cold winter did not prevent them from making an effort to discover Jordan. We asked each one of them which is their favorite activity or place so far. Check out their responses below! </p>
                <h3> Gala (11): </h3>
                    <p>"I just love that there are some very impressive arqueological sites, nature reserves and wonderful hikes. So far though my favorite place is Wadi Rum because it feels like being in a Star Wars movie. The skies are so clear and at nights you can go to a place where they have large telescopes, I saw many stars and the moon." </p>
                <h3> Mar (13): </h3>
                    <p>"I have been drawing and painting my whole life and love taking art classes and learning new techniques. Amman is surprinsingly full of art schools. I go to two different art schools every week, but my favorite one is Jodar Artistry in Khalda. They teach me how to paint with oil in a very familiar and comfortable atmosphere, my teacher gives me space to explore my own ideas and take risks. I go every Saturday and it is addictive." </p>
                <h3> Veronica (mom): </h3>
                    <p>"We have been to most of the Jordanian famous arqueological sites and there are many!like Petra, the Citadel and others. For some reason Jerash is one of my favorites. It is close to Amman, so you can do it as a daytrip, but you can feel the weight of history in that place." </p>
                <h3> Gonzalo (dad): </h3>
                    <p>"I did not have too high expectations when going to Aqaba since we had been living in the Caribbean for 7 years before coming to the Middle East. The beach and resorts are nice, but my favorite activity was diving in the Red Rea. There are really good places that help you dive for a few hours. I could fulfill one of my lifelong dreams. Diving is Aqaba is thrilling!" </p>
